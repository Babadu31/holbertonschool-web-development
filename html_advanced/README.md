How to create an HTML page from a wireframe :
To create an HTML page from a wireframe, you would first need to create a rough sketch or design of the layout of the page. This is known as a wireframe. From there, you can use HTML tags to create the different sections and elements of the page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. You can also use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to add styling and formatting to the page.

What is a markup language :
A markup language is a system for annotating text in a way that is distinguishable from the text itself. HTML is a markup language because it uses tags to indicate how text should be displayed in a web page.

What is the DOM :
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects, allowing developers to manipulate the content of a web page dynamically.
